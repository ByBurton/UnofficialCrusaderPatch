This project is an unofficial patcher for [FireFly Studio's](https://fireflyworlds.com/) game Stronghold Crusader 1.
It features bug-fixes, balancing and quality-of-life changes, as well as several AIV castles.
To apply this patch you need to have Stronghold Crusader installed, the setup does not include any files
created by FireFly Studios, but instead edits them or adds community-made files.

To install the patch you just have to download the [latest UnofficialCrusaderPatch.exe release](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases), execute it and choose the correct path of your Stronghold Crusader installation. You can then select several features you wish to install, recommended presettings are selected by default. The patch should work for most Crusader versions, but the latest 1.41 HD version is recommended. If your version is not supported, which can happen if you install it from a CD for example, you should receive errors during the installation. To avoid this you can install FireFly's [Crusader HD patch](http://www.strongholdcrusaderhd.com/patch.html) for free, which should support all of the unofficial changes.

If you have suggestions, you are welcome to post new ideas or discuss already existing ones in the [issues section](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/issues). It would be great if you could follow these guidelines:
- try to only post one idea per issue to help me keeping an overview
- try to check if your suggestion already has a topic and join that discussion instead of creating a new one
- keep the tone nice and civil
