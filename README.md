This project is an unofficial patcher for [FireFly Studio's](https://fireflyworlds.com/) game Stronghold Crusader 1.
It features bug-fixes, balancing and quality-of-life changes, as well as several AIV castles.
To apply this patch you need to have Stronghold Crusader installed, the setup does not include any files
created by FireFly Studios, but instead edits them or adds community-made files.

To install you just have to download the [latest UnofficialCrusaderPatch.exe release](https://github.com/Sh0wdown/UnofficialCrusaderPatch/releases), execute it and choose the correct path of your Stronghold Crusader installation. You can then choose from several features you want to install, a recommended presetting is selected by default.

The patch should work on most Crusader Version, if not you will receive errors during the installation.

At this point I would like to thank the Stronghold community for supporting me so enthusiastically.
